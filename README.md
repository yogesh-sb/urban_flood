High-resolution Flood Predictive System (HiFloodS)
Overview
HiFloodS is robust and open-sourced system consisting of hydraulic model, open-source earth database and machine learning approaches. This system aims to reduce the computational barriers often encountered during the hydraulic modeling of urban basin.
Points to be considered:
•	All the database should have same co-ordinate system
•	Hyperparameter tuning of the model is required for ensuring the predictive capability.
